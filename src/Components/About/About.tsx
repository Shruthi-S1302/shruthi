          Hello, wonderful people of the internet!ðŸ‘‹{" "}
        </h3>
        <p>
          I'm Shruthi, a passionate computer science student at Vellore
          Institute of Technology. Back in my school days, I was a dedicated
          nerd, always striving for top grades and academic excellence. However,
          as I delved deeper into the world of technology and software, my
          perspective shifted. Now, I aspire to make a genuine impact with my
          work and create solutions that truly matter, rather than simply
          seeking praise. My current journey involves exploring a diverse range
          of exciting fields, including Web Development, Software Engineering,
          Blockchain, Artificial Intelligence, and Natural Language Processing.
          But that's not all, I also have a flair for the artistic side and
          dream of venturing into the realms of UI and UX design. Music is my
          constant source of serenity, especially when debugging becomes a
          challenge. As an avid reader (a proud Potterhead ðŸª„), I find joy in
          getting lost in the world of fiction. Above all, my goal is to
          leverage my talents and contribute meaningfully to the world. <br />

          Thanks for your patience in getting to know me better!
